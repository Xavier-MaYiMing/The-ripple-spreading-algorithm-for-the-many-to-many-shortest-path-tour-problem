##### Reference: 马一鸣，胡小兵，周航. 一种快速求解最短路径巡游问题的涟漪扩散算法[J]. 计算机应用研究.

The shortest path tour problem aims to find the shortest path that traverses multiple disjoint node subsets in a given order. The many-to-many shortest path tour problem has multiple sources and destinations. It aims to determine the shortest path tour for every source node to any one of the destination nodes.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_network = {
        0: {1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 3},
        1: {0: 2, 3: 2},
        2: {0: 3, 3: 3},
        3: {0: 3, 1: 2, 2: 3, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 3},
        4: {3: 2, 6: 2},
        5: {3: 3, 6: 3},
        6: {3: 3, 4: 2, 5: 3},
    }
    subset = [[0, 2], [1, 3], [5, 6]]
    print(main(test_network, subset))
```

##### Output

```python
{
    0: {'path': [0, 3, 5], 'length': 6}, 
    2: {'path': [2, 3, 5], 'length': 6},
}
```
